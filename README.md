# Sudoku_Solver
Another typical coding project for coders to code to learn important coding concepts.

## Coding Concepts
- Once you've learnt recursion, you've learnt recursion, unless you forget, in which case you need to learn recursion again!

## Notes
There are many references available online to learn recursion via solving sudoku, the one I like most is this [YouTube video by Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM).
